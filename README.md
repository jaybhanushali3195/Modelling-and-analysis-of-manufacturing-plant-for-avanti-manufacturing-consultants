# Modelling and analysis of manufacturing plant for avanti manufacturing consultants
<p>1)Detailed analysis of the approaches, given the resources WFMC currently possess and the demand forecasts predicted for 2017 has been carried out
<p>2)Objective has been kept in mind while designing and laying out the facility of the plant to achieve feasible production rates without letting the throughput times go beyond limits and keeping the queue lengths as short as possible.
<p>3)The design has been made in a way that the demand is at least met by the production rate for each part.
<p>4)Goals such as maximizing average machine utilizations, minimizing the flow of parts between groups so as to reduce material handling and minimizing setup time.
<p>5)We employ the technique of group technology so as to incorporate the various different types of products belonging to different families which are manufactured on different machines. 
<p>6)Queueing analysis is conducted next to analyze the performance of the system, which is followed by cost analysis  and facility layout.
<p>7)Proposed a model that would bring drastic reduction in machines required reducing annual cost by 30%.
8)Suggested a Mitigation technique using conveyer belt that would save $1.5 million anually that are spent on Labor.
