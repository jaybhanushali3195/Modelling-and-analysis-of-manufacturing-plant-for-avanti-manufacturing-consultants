# Modelling and analysis of manufacturing plant for avanti manufacturing consultants
<p>1)Detailed analysis of the approaches, given the resources WFMC currently possess and the demand forecasts predicted for 2017 has been carried out
<p>2)Scheduling Is done using Johnsonâ€™s algorithm with objectives like maximizing average machine utilizations, minimizing the flow of parts between groups so as to reduce material handling and minimizing setup time are also considered.
<p>2)Designing of facility layout has been done using Group technology to acheive feasible production rates without letting the throughput times go beyond limits,minimizing queue length.
<p>3)The design has been made in a way that the demand is at least met by the production rate for each part.
<p>6)Queueing analysis is conducted next to analyze the performance of the system, which is followed by cost analysis  and facility layout.
<p>7)Proposed a model that would bring drastic reduction in machines required reducing annual cost by 30%.
<p>8)Suggested a Mitigation technique using conveyer belt that would save $1.5 million anually that are spent on Labor.
